        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          Experienced IT engineer with a strong background in IT support, system administration, and process automation. 
          I am passionate about technology, delivering efficient solutions, and maintaining robust infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years, Iâ€™ve worked in the film industry, managing Windows, Linux, and macOS environments while ensuring compliance with network security protocols and TPN regulations. 
          I have led projects to automate workflows using PowerShell and PowerFX, significantly improving operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          My roles at The Third Floor and Jellyfish Pictures have equipped me with the ability to solve complex IT challenges, manage cross-functional projects, and mentor junior engineers. 
          I thrive on staying current with the latest tech trends, especially in automation and cloud technologies. 
          Outside of work, I am dedicated to fitness and compete in CrossFit competitions, bringing the same drive to my professional life.
